<p class="p5">Attempting to secure a dealership license is a daunting process. Not only does the State mandate an avalanche of applications but also an exacting array of building requirements. To lighten the process, we provide easy-to-follow dealership licensing information for each specific state
If you're in the business of selling cars, you've come to the right place.
Licensing Requirements Becoming a car dealer isn't easy. Find out about the DMV regulations and the stringent application process.
Salesperson License If you want to find out about selling cars in your state, here's your chance.
Dealer-related Information Keep your finger on the pulse of the car biz with the latest DMV regulations and trends.


You won't find any information that is written in a manner that requires an attorney to translate. All of our dealership pages are composed in a straightforward tone. Most, in fact, include lists of requirements, alleviating the pain of having to sift through lengthy paragraphs for one nugget of information.
In all, these pages offer three separate dealership categories: licensing requirements, dealer forms and dealer-related information.

You'll also learn each state's dealership building requirements including the size of street signs, size of display lots, number of phone lines, and the posting of operating hours. And, you'll also uncover tips and advice on state Lemon Laws and the dangers of deceptive advertising
    Plus, you'll find downloadable application forms, including bill of sale and odometer disclosure statements, saving you the hassle of trying to track them down at a Department of Motor Vehicle office</p>

                    <p class="p5">When it comes to getting behind the wheel of a world-class sports car or luxury ride, it’s handy if you have either a trust fund or a seven-figure salary.
